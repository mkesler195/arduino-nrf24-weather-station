# Arduino nRF24 Wireless Weather Station

This repository documents a modular Arduino-based wireless weather station built using nRF24L01 radios. The project is being developed incrementally, starting with a fully implemented and documented base station.

## Current Status

- Base station hardware and firmware are implemented and documented
- Remote sensor nodes are planned but not yet documented

## System Overview

The weather station system is designed around a simple architecture:

### Base Station
- Arduino Uno
- nRF24L01 radio
- OLED display
- DS3231 real-time clock (RTC)

### Remote Sensor Nodes (planned)
- Battery-powered Arduino-compatible boards
- Environmental sensors
- nRF24L01 radios
